# Constrained Policy Gradient Method for Safe and Fast Reinforcement Learning: a Neural Tangent Kernel Based Approach

**Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.09139

**Description:** Source code for the NTK based constrained REINFORCE algorithm in the Cartpole OpenAi Gym environment. `Constrained_PG_CartPole.py` trains the agent defined in `PolicyNet.py`. Constraint types can be selected with the variable `CONSTRAINT_TYPE`. Constrained points alongside with some helper functions are included in `Functions.py`. An example trained agent is added in `cartpole_agent_ineq.p` that can be tested with `TestAgent_CartPole.py`.
